Making figure is very often in our day to day scientific research. With such great amount of figures, I found some of them very artsy and they bring me extra pleasure when I am tired staring at the screen. Therefore, I start this repo to curate these awesome figure I made and I hope you will enjoy it too.

##### Mondrian's

This graph is made when I tried to show the matching score between two attirubted related graphs. The black and white boxes remind me [Piet Mondrian's work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piet_Mondrian).

##### Horse Tail

This graph is made when I tried to compare some normal distributions result. It's a great color and it looks like a horse tail. The pixel points present a great texture.

##### Play Station (in candy flavor)

This graph is made when I tried to use t-sne to visualize my amino acid vector representation with a zoom in effect. I use different shape and color to represent different amino acids and they turn out to be the key in our Play Station controller, with a more colorful vibe.
